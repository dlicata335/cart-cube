  cart-cube.pdf    -- current version of paper
  cart-cube-v2.pdf -- second version paper
                      (lacking some presentational improvements)
  cart-cube-v1.pdf -- orignal version of paper
                      (with a different composition for Glue types)

  The formalization that corresponds exactly to the paper is
  browsable[http://dlicata.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/pubs/abcfhl/agda/ABCFHL-MSCS.html] and
  downloadable[https://dlicata.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/pubs/abcfhl/abcfhl.tar.gz].
  
  The code in this repository includes that, as well as some other, related material:
  agda/ -- full Agda formalization
           (compile ABCFHL.agda to check everything)

  These have been tested with Agda 2.6.1.2, which includes the 'flat' modality
  that was previously in a special agda-flat branch.
